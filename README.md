# Mini Twitter

## Description
Mini Twitter is a Java desktop application developed using Java Swing that simulates the core functionalities of Twitter. This application allows users to create posts, follow other users, and much more, mimicking the social networking experience. It incorporates several design patterns including Singleton, Observer, and Visitor to ensure efficient data management and user interface interaction.

## Features

- **User Management**: Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Follow System**: Users can follow and unfollow others, similar to traditional social media platforms.
- **Tweet Posting**: Users can post tweets, which are visible to their followers.
- **Real-time Updates**: Utilizes the Observer pattern to update user feeds in real-time as new tweets are posted or when new followers are added.
- **Analytics**: Implements the Visitor pattern to provide statistics such as the number of tweets, follows, and other interactions.
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Singleton**: Ensures that classes such as the main application window are instantiated only once.
  - **Observer**: Manages notifications and updates across the user interface when data changes.
  - **Visitor**: Allows for the execution of operations across a set of objects at runtime, facilitating easy extension and maintenance.


## What I learned

I was able to enhance my Java skills by implementing multiple design patterns and create a clone of a complex social media platform.
